We had no communication via AirBnB as the experience is purely as a hotel - arrive to reception on the 6th floor of the Muji flagship store, and check in.<br/>We felt the room was better than the pictures actually - the pictures avoid showing it's a very deep, corridor-like room, but we found that to be preferable to our expectations, which was that it would be very small.<br/>Reception staff are very helpful, calling taxis for us and holding our luggage even after check-out. Normal stuff for a hotel, but worth mentioning.<br/>Many Muji commodities are available in the room, from toothbrushes to slippers. All in very minimalist, elegant design, which we enjoyed greatly.<br/>The hotel is connected to the shop, too, so it's easy to do some shopping and then drop it off in the room.</div>`)[0];

The only downside is that we stayed one night - would have easily been able to spend a couple of days here!<br><br>Score: 5.0<br>Review: Thank you so much for a welcoming stay!

The nearest station (Shin Okubo station) is a short ~10 min walk away from you. It's a smaller station with only one exit so you won't get lost, and you won't have to deal with large swaths of people passing through either. Super convenient to get around overall.<br/>Lots of great food that's close by while being tucked away in a residential neighbourhood so it's very quiet. The space itself is clean and has everything that you need for a comfortable stay. Water pressure in the shower was excellent. There is a washing machine on the balcony of the unit. It's a washing machine only with no dryer functionality (it does have an air spin cycle but no heated drying) so keep in mind you'll need time to hang your clothes dry. Overall a great place to stay in Tokyo!</div>`)[0];

We also appreciate the number of cloth hangers provided and the washing machine.<br/>The couple things we struggled with, was the size of toilet (hard to sit inside with door closed for an adult) and the noise from neighbours during the second half of our stay...

It’s absolutely perfect if you’re looking for somewhere quiet, comfortable and spacious. It has a bright, open, homely feel and is extremely practical with all the amenities you could need. The local area is very peaceful and benefits from being a little way away from the nearby stations, of which there are conveniently several to choose from. The walk is shorter than you might think and while a little busy toward the station in the morning, it’s extremely pleasant through the park in the evening. The apartment’s most noteworthy asset however, comes in the form of its hosts: Rika and her husband, who are genuinely two of the most welcoming, generous and dedicated hosts I’ve ever had the pleasure of encountering. They run the very tasty cafe next door which is well worth a visit in its own right, and were extremely flexible with their availability and ever so abundant with their hospitality.

The place looks like the photos, but the beautiful art feels even more inviting and immersive in person. The host met me in the lobby bar for check in, which was very easy and fast. After that, however, it felt like I was staying in an abandoned building, as no one else was in the building for the majority of the time. I believe the building is three stories, with the lobby bar on the first floor and one room on each of the remaining floors. I was sad to miss out on the friendly, lively lobby bar described in other reviews, but it honestly wasn't the biggest deal - just different from what I expected.

So retro and nostalgic! I came in late spring when the neighborhood was filled with beautiful flora. All the best attractions in Yanaka, Nezu, and even Ueno are accessible by foot. On the way anywhere you'll pass by many small, trendy cafes and restaurants.<br/>Nennekoya itself is very homey, made all the warmer by Mie-san's collection of cat art and paraphernalia. Mie is also so friendly and welcoming. There are four adorable cats at the moment and they're all approachable. <br/>Just be aware that this is not a hotel accommodation (although the hosts provide so many nice amenities!)

For someone on a budget, it had everything I needed - a washing machine, place to hang and dry my clothes, toilet that was clean and amenities, stove, fridge, bed and a table and chair fit into a small cozy room! The location was a dream - only 4 minutes ish away from Akabane station, which connects to so many major lines and is only a few stops away from Ueno, Shinjuku, Shibuya etc. There are a few shopping malls nearby and even a few food districts and my favourite is a nearby tsukemen store that I still dream about lol. The host was extremely friendly and even sent me directions to get to the room! It was a very convenient complex and everything was clean and tidy, and there are even pharmacies, supermarkets, little trinket shops all within 100m of the vicinity, it’s super convenient. I highly recommend staying here if you want a smaller room that is otherwise convenient and accessible with a communicative host.

Great place to come home to after a day of Tokyo exploring! The quiet Omotesando/ Aoyama neighborhood felt very safe. But it was a pleasant surprise that a few blocks away, great restaurants, cafes, bars and a multitude of shops are nearby. Beds are comfy and generously sized for two. Bathroom area is quite big, well lit, with a separate toilet room, and a nice corner for the vanity / sink. Shower and bath tub have hot water and strong water pressure. Hosts are thoughtful and gracious. Met us at check-in, showed how things work, gave maps and recos.  They live nearby, but still gave us a lot of space and privacy on our own. Love the personal touches- from pretty flowers in vases, to kitchen and coffee amenities, to toiletries and even cozy bathrobes.

They also checked in on me through my week long stay, and called a cab for me to the airport (and negotiated the fee down).

There's also quite a few nice shops places to eat in the neighborhood, and you definitely get that local vibe that you wouldn't staying at a hotel in the city center.

As my wife managed to push all stuffs in and we are tired after train trip, we appreciate but skip his offer.

It also happens to be down an alley in a quiet area so you won't be woken up by city noise, but walkable to anything you'd need. The apartment itself is great, two small bedrooms, two bathrooms and a big sink that doubles for kitchen/bathroom use. It was a perfect size for two friends who want their own rooms and own bathrooms each. The beds only fit one person, slightly larger than a regular twin size. Shower quality is great and the AC is great. The only downfall of this place was the poor quality of the wifi, we had to use our hotspot data to work remotely as zoom/video streaming did not work well. Thankfully we only needed it for 2 out of the 6 days of our stay. Overall- highly recommend!! Thank you Ya. :-)</div>`)[0];

Asakusa sta. is one station away, and there is a direct train line going to Shibuya that is about 20-30 mins away. Though we did not have a chance to use it, Disney has a direct bus from Disney station nearby Oshiage Sta. If going via train, would need to take multiple trains.<br/>There is 7-eleven across the street and some restaurants in the surrounding area. Tokyo Skytree can also be seen from the window of our unit. The area is more spacious than some hotels, good enough for the 3 of us. There is garbage segregation so you need to be mindful when throwing trash. There is no elevator so you might want to consider higher floor units if you have luggage. Also, take note of the instructions for entering the building as it is quite confusing at first. There is a T.V but no local reception. Overall experience with this Airbnb is great for us!</div>`)[0];

The bathroom had good hot water.<br/>I didn’t use the kitchen but there are some pots and pans and a rice cooker if you want it. But there is so much fantastic inexpensive food all around Nakano that you likely won’t want to cook. And there is a small coffee shop with wonderful coffee and matcha and chocolate cake directly downstairs.<br/>The location is great. It’s just a couple of blocks to the Nakano covered shopping streets that take you to Broadway and Nakano Station.

Right next (across the street) from Nakano Broadway which has great restaurants lots of shopping (particularly if you are a hobbyist). This is a main train station so easy access all over Tokyo. I stayed with my son and we had planned to be out much of the time. The place is very small. Only really suitable for 2 people for short periods. The balcony is tough to reach. This may be fine for Japanese but not for Americans. Kasumi was super responsive every time, especially to the big issue we had which was the wifi didn't work. I believe this will get fixed - she has a backup. The building instructions missed one last step. Summary: If you are just looking for a place to sleep this is great. If you have a lot of "stuff" then I suggest this could be too small. It would not be suitable for a first time visit to Tokyo if an American, but for the experienced couple this could be great.

The whole building is new. The first floor has a bedroom, toilet, and a bathroom with washing machine. This is only floor that you can take shower and brush teeth. The second floor is the living room and the kitchen. You have to take the luggage to this floor with a narrow stair, cause first floor has very limited space. The third floor had 2 bedrooms and a toilet, this floor is little bit hot. I have to keep both AC running for a while to cool it down. Otsuka Station is very convenient which is about 12-15mints away from the apartment. You can get to most popular places with JY line in few stops. The only downside is when you walk from the station to the apartment, you have to pass more than half of the way in a very quiet area next to the railroad, which you would feel scared at night alone. Overall, it was a great experience to live in Tomoaki's apartment and very comfortable. I would say 4 to 6 people will be the best to accommodate.</div>`)[0];

Streaming shows was very intermittent couldn’t watch high resolution. Speed tests averaged 3-12mbps down / 120mbps up. TPLink router was a low end / older unit that doesn’t support IKE VPN if you’re someone that needs this. I wish there was more storage! There was a huge shoe closet for 20 shoes but no real drawers or closest space for clothes (would be nice if you were able to have storage underneath the bed just not designed that way). There was a small bar to hang clothes but there is only 4 hangers. No complaints about anything else. Great fridge, kitchen, bath, amenities. I would easily stay again at this location.</div>`)[0];

It is a 20 minute walk from the closest “tourist” area but the walk is uncomfortable and feels hardly safe, and this is coming from a Tijuana, MX resident. The place itself isn’t so bad, though there was a smell of stale cigarette smoke, it was still clean and you could tell the attentive host put a lot of effort into it. I hate to leave a review as the host was certainly decent, but of all the many generally lesser-desired areas of the world I have stayed in, this is the only AirBNB I have ever checked out of the very early morning after.

If I'm tourists who came to travel had to buy the curtain myself, there would be absolutely no way right?<br/>"There are no amenities like pillows, towels, bath towels, soaps, shampoos, toothbrushes, detergents, etc. in the room." It was said that all consumables are prepared individually, I thought it will be a bit inconvenient only. But there was 3 huge windows without curtain, the owner should told us early before we check-in. So I contacted the owner, and he says "About curtains ... I hope you can buy your favorite curtains for yourself. As you can imagine, that room is not a short term lending, It is a room that is supposed to be lent for long. "<br/>So I slept without curtain and pillow on the first day, but the sun was extremely strong in the morning and I could not sleep from around 4 o'clock in the morning. I stayed for about 2 weeks and I really do not want to buy it myself, but I can not even sleep well at all without the curtain. I have no choice but to buy it all by myself. I choose this place is because I want to lower down the cost of my trip, this is the reason why I picking this place which apart from the center of Tokyo, this happened already made me became out of the budget. <br/>Also it took about an hour to go to Shinjuku and Tokyo Station, and a round trip cost about 1000 yen. In my case with my boyfriend, the transportation total cost us more than 2000 yen a day for round-trip.<br/>Rental house + transportation expenses + expendable items etc = about the same as the place in the center of Tokyo<br/>From the station it took about 8 - 10 minutes by walk can reach the house. I can not say it is really close, but it is not so far too.<br/>There are only 7-Eleven convenience stores nearby. Nearest restaurant is only Chinese cuisine, supermarket in front of the station only open until 8pm. So if you go home late at night, there are only Chinese cuisine and seven eleven still open, it is a bit disappointing.<br/>The shower room, the kitchen, the toilet etc collected a lot of dust. Many hairs on the drainage of the toilet and shower room from the first day. I do not know how long it did not clean up, but I stayed for about two weeks, but both place remained as it was. Nobody cleans up.<br/>I stayed for about 2 weeks. The owner will reply me fast if I contact him. The rental fees were also discounted.

The space of the apartment I’d say is adequate to accomodate 3 adults. Not to crapmy, just nice. This trip to Japan I have moved to 3 different apartment and only Tomoko’s place provided the rice cooker which is life saver. We are muslims and it’s quite challenging to find muslim restaurants nearby so before and after going out of the apartment I’d cook simple meal for my family so we filled our tummy before going out. <br/>To improve: I hope what I suggest would help Tomoko to improve for the next guest.

Tomoko's apartment is very cozy, nicely decorated and easy to feel at home in it. It is very clean although the neighbours like to smoke right outside the windows (but this is not really Tomoko's fault). The neighbourhood is nice and very safe and there is a good supermarket (Summit) nearby. The price was very reasonable as well and Tomoko is always available (via airbnb) to help with anything. <br/>On the downside: It is quite difficult to find, even with instructions! We found the location to be too far from the station, about 22 minute walk. It is true that there is a bus (every 20 min) but it costs about 2 dollars one way pp so if it's 2 of you it will be 8 dollars a day extra on top of the price of the tube/train.

In the end I met a friend of hers in Shinjuku and she provided portable wifi).<br/>Our biggest issue was, the day before our departure the opportunity to extend our stay in Japan came up. I messaged Tomoko to check if the apartment would be available (as it appeared as not available in airbnb) and she said that yes, it was. The following day (I needed time to check other things before confirming the booking) when I messaged her to confirm the dates she said that the place was taken! She said there had just been a booking. After a month staying at her place she didn't check with us before giving the place to other guests, even though I had messaged her the day before saying we needed to stay longer. This was a huge inconvenience for us as there is very little accommodation available around new year's so we had to cancel our plans of staying longer in Japan.<br/>Overall it was a mixed stay for us but we had the best time in Tokyo!<br><br>Score: 3.47<br>Review: We stayed at Tomoko's place for a month in Tokyo.

Everyehere is simple, white and clean，which is totally same as the picture posted at the app . It is suitable for us five people to live. Six people might be the maximum. All kind of tools are easy to use. It is at residential aera,  so kind of far away from the ikebukuro station. Need to tranfer at North ikebukuro if you want to walk less. But if you want to walk in the typical Japan style community, living here will be a nice choice, which is a different experience from living in a hotel.<br><br>Score: 3.5<br>Review: 隔音很差</div>`)[0];

Die Lage des Apartments ist allerdings suboptimal da es quasi direkt an einer Hauptverkehrsroute für Autos liegt und somit äußerst viel Lärm durch die Wände dringt (vor allem nachts). Zudem sind die umliegenden Straßen sobald es dunkel wird sehr dunkel und leer. Nur wenn man Richtung Ikebukuro Station läuft trifft man auf mehr Menschen und findet mehr Möglichkeiten zu essen oder zu trinken. Auch das Haus selber (besonders die Flure) sind ziemlich heruntergekommen und geben einem nicht das Gefühl von Sicherheit. Letztlich ist das Gesamtpaket jedoch durch den günstigen Preis zu rechtfertigen (zumindest hat man ein eigenes Badezimmer & Küche).</div>`)[0];

It seems like it was recently renovated and is now run more like a (although clean and modern) hostel.<br/>Especially for foreign travelers who have read about ryokans and are excited to stay at one, it can be a bit disappointing after having more of a hostel-experience:<br/>Despite there being a check in counter at the building, we never saw anyone there the entire time we were there. After a long day of traveling, it is nice and helpful to be received by an friendly face at a front desk who can also help with translation issues or giving tips about the city. It is what makes the difference between a ryokan with personal attention and an anonymous hostel. The rooms contain the bare minimum; a simple small mirror or some shelves would have been helpful. Check-in was quite late and check-out rather on the early side in comparison to other stays.<br/>Other than that: host was very quick & responsive, and instructions were sufficiently clear, the entrance to the building is nice and it smells like pine wood, most likely because it is newly renovated.

Although Hatsudai station (Keio line) looks like its far, you just have to take the north exit & its pretty clear cut. However, we did had trouble finding our way back once the train stopped for the night. Had to walk from Shinjuku all the way. Kinda tiring with Tokyo’s unpredictable slopes haha. <br/>The place was slightly small and definitely wont be able to fit 3 person. As much as sofa bed is displayed, it is too tight of a space to utilise for sleep. However, the bed was comfortable. All the amenities listed was working well. From the dryfan to the bidet. <br/>However, do take note and be careful of the stairs. It is extremely narrow & the edge of the stairs are sharp too. Had a few instances where I almost fell. Other than that, I can’t complain much. There’s even a working washing machine. Just missing an iron & ironing board hahaha. Thanks for the stay!! Loved it!!</div>`)[0];

There’s a convenient store nearby, Ministop that’s not as popular as the Big 3 but sufficient to get your basic necessities and snacks. FYI, Family Mart can be found closer to Iriya Station, where you’d typically embark/disembark. Oh and there’s a local grocery store/supermarket as well (about 5 mins away on foot). More choices and wider selection. <br/>The walls can be pretty thin; heard footsteps from the unit above and conversations from guests next door.

But be prepared to walk up and down some hills on the way to find it, so if you have a lot of luggage, you are warned.  It is exactly 8-9 minutes from the JR station, where you will get on to go to other places. It’s only a couple of stops from Shinjuku and Shibuya.

The room that you're renting is  small with enough room for you and your stuff, if there are two people then one person gets the top bunk and the other has a futon on the floor. It looked like there was an AC unit for the summer but for the winter there was just a heated rug and a heating pad. 
<br/>
<br/>As for the amenities, I was incorrect when I read it before. I thought that it said Essentials when it doesn't.  There is a shower/bath (Ofuro) that you can use which was really clean. (This is probably what she means but 'Hot Tub' in the amenities section) It seemed like it was in the main house though so I wouldn't use it late at night. There were no towels or toiletries supplied.   
<br/>
<br/>Next the the bathroom there was a room with a small TV, heater, cooking area, LAN cable.  
<br/>
<br/>I would say that the location, while difficult to find, was fairly convenient especially when you consider the price. It's about a 15min walk from the station, there are several restaurants on the way as well as several convenience stores. <br><br>Score: 3.82<br>Review: 這是我第一次使用Airbnb，整個從預訂到入住的經驗都很好。
<br/>
<br/>首先，房東由紀子小姐每次回訊息都在24小時以內就回覆，並且很詳盡的解釋房子的交通方式和地點(包含英文及日文),讓人很安心。
<br/>
<br/>房子的地點並不在東京23區內，不過從新宿坐京王線只要25分鐘、最慢1小時3分即抵達(單程日幣320元)，且到下北澤、調布、高尾山、三鷹、吉祥寺、自由之丘非常方便。還蠻推薦給並非第一次到東京，想往東京西部近郊旅遊的人。
<br/>
<br/>房間內的情況 : 我們是訂雙人住的雅房，木頭地板、睡上下舖。房間有冷氣沒有暖氣，不過房東給我們每人3、4層的鋪床被和棉被，下鋪還有電毯、上鋪有小暖爐。睡得十分舒服。房間及公共空間也很乾淨。唯獨院子內目前還在整理、有比較多雜物，晚上經過的時候,需要比較小心。
<br/>
<br/>很喜歡這次的住宿經驗，像是住在學生公寓的感覺，附近也都是住宅區,很安靜,很悠閒。房東由紀子小姐人親切、可愛。下次到日本希望還能入住~<br><br>Score: 3.82<br>Review: 都内の美術館に行くために、2泊お世話になりました。<br/>夜に着いたために、周りの状況が分からず、かつ、グーグルマップを参考にしたので急な坂道を遠回りさせられました。<br/>ホストはあらかじめ詳しい道順を教えてくれましたが、グーグルマップでは遠回りすることを一言添えてもらえたらさらにありがたかったです。<br/>部屋は、事前に伝えられたように確かに狭かったのですが、それよりも1月に行ったために暖房が電気カーペットしかなかったことと(部屋が狭すぎて換気の関係で冷房しか設置できないとのこと)、髪の毛や爪がかなり落ちていたりホコリっぽかったりと、清掃があまり行き届いていなかったのが残念でした。<br/>ホストの由紀子さんは親しみやすく親切で、気さくな方でした。<br/>お風呂はバスタブも付いていて、快適でした。<br/>ダイニングキッチンでは、器やフライパンなど少しの調理器具はあったものの、調味料の類や箸や包丁も無かったので、もう少し揃えてあれば調理もできてさらに条件が良くなると思いました。<br/>暖房と清掃が改善されれば、格安で条件もかなり良いお部屋だと思います。<br><br>Score: 3.82<br>Review: The living space was much smaller than expected. The bed is comfortable and the room has adequate heating and sufficient space to store a suitcase plus a few additional bags. It's more suitable for a short stay if you simply want a bed and somewhere to dump your things.
<br/>
<br/>The rooms are in a separate newly-built section and contain a shared 'washlet' toilet, a sink and a gas hob. The bathroom is in the main house and is modern but it's not ideal to move to a different building to wash. The kitchen is also in the house and has a microwave, toaster oven, more hobs and a refrigerator. Pots, pans, utensils and cutlery are a bit limited and it doesn't lend itself to cooking much beyond basic meals.
<br/>
<br/>The area itself is residential and quiet but on a steep slope and up steep steps - not great for heavy luggage! The location is pretty convenient and only about 10 minutes walk from Takahatafudo Station (Tama Monorail and Keio Line). There are enough shops,  supermarkets, cafes and restaurants around the station and the Takahatafudoson Temple with its impressive five-storey pagoda is within easy walking distance.

I would not recommend that anyone stay here, unless they are absolutely desperate.<br/>This listing offers a very small room (no complaints at the price point, the size was exactly what I was looking for), with disconnected common room and bath areas. The room itself was nice: air-con, outlets, a desk. The place is about a 10-15 minute walk from the nearest station, which is about 30 minutes to an hour away from Shinjuku. The walls are extremely thin, but the room is great if you only plan on using it as a place to sleep. <br/>The problem with this listing is the common areas, and the bathroom. This listing is a dorm-style room, meaning that all tenants share the same living quarters outside of their individual rooms. These public areas are disgusting. After checking in on my first night, I saw a small cockroach scurry across the dirt stained hallway. The next morning, I found a rather large cockroach dead in the shower. The hand soap in the kitchen is covered with older dead ants. The outdoor areas look as though they were constructed almost entirely out of scavenged trash from a junk yard.

It was also very good to get an answer quickly when I asked the host a question. It is a house located right next to the track, so it is not recommended for people who are sensitive to noise. When checking in, there were many similar houses around, so it was slightly difficult to find even after looking at the map.

Takahatafuto is still a major station on Keio Line, so it takes only 35min to Shinjuku if you time the express train right. It's convenient enough for me as I was meeting up with friends in Ikebukuro/Shinjuku for shopping. But if you want to visit places like Akihabara, Asakusa and Team Lab Planet which is located more on the East side of Tokyo, you may consider other options near Chiba.<br/>Amenities like tissue paper, towels are supplied generously, it would be better if the host can also provide some garbage bags, at least for burnable garbage.  The facilities are a little bit old, but still works well. The best thing to me is the large supermarket nearby that sells raw fish and meat at a very good price. I don't have to dine out.  Basically I cooked for myself everyday. Also there are drug stores and various convenient stores nearby. Overall I like this place.</div>`)[0];
